- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...
- âš¡ Fun fact: ...
-->

- ðŸ¥‡ I'm proficient with:
  - torch, scikit-learn, scikit-optimize, gplearn, numpy/scipy/statsmodels, pandas, xgboost/catboost/lgbm, matplotlib/seaborn/plotly, albumentations, category_encoders, HF transformers/diffusers, llamacpp, qdrant, fastapi, celery, streamlit
  
- ðŸ¥ˆ I know my way around:
  - spark, SQL, keras/tensorflow, OpenGL, OpenCV, CI/CD pipelines
  
- ðŸŽ– Since I started, I've learned how to:
  - never accept the null hypothesis;
  - stop misinterpreting p-values;
  - read impurity-based, permutation and SHAP feature importances properly;
  - spot the outliers in several dimensions at once with Mahalanobis distance;
  - combat skewness with QuantileTransformer/PowerTransformer;
  - calibrate;
  - avoid the PCA trap in classification;
  - engineer features with symbolic regression;
  - effectively finetune SD using Dreambooth technique;
  - use vector databases to supply context for language models;

- ðŸŽ– In the past year, I've learned:
  - the actual difference between Adam and AdamW;
  - proper separation of evaluation and decision making;
  - the power of generalized linear models;
  - numerous applications IoU may have;
  - the match between kernel regression and two-layer neural networks;
  - augmenting the embeddings rather than raw data;
  - that the LOOCV MSE for KNN equals the training MSE for (K+1)NN;
  - the importance of embeddings' distances for the reasoning of LLMs;
  - the difficulties of separating epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty;
  - how to evaluate ensembling quality using information theory;
  - how to beat OpenAI using a 7B model running on CPU.
